 * Coverage gate: CI fails the build (and therefore the PR) when any metric
 * drops below its threshold, so coverage cannot silently erode.
 *
 * `collectCoverageFrom` deliberately covers all of src rather than only the
 * files a test happens to import. Without it, a module with no tests at all
 * simply would not appear in the report and the percentage would flatter
 * itself -- which is exactly how this repo used to report 73% while real
 * coverage was 49%.
