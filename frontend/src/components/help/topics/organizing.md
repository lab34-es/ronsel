Three things organize flows, and they build on each other: **folders** give
them a place, **properties** give them metadata, and **views** turn a folder
into a table you can filter, sort, run and hand to a pipeline.

## Folders

The `flows/` tree is yours: create folders from the `+` next to **Flows**,
nest them as deep as you like, rename and delete from each row's actions.
The first level tends to be the system or the team (`checkout/`,
`warehouse/`), the levels below the feature. The top folder is also what the
HTML report calls a *suite*, so a meaningful first level reads well there.

## Properties

Every key in a flow's frontmatter is a property, and everything the tool does
with metadata reads them (see [The flow document](/help/flows)). A small,
agreed set goes a long way:

    ---
    title: Refund after a failed delivery
    owner: ana
    suite: smoke
    tags: [refund, logistics]
    priority: 8
    reviewed: true
    ---

Nothing declares these; the value is the type. A list like `tags` is what
*has tag* filters on, a number sorts numerically, a boolean is a checkbox.
The **Document** view edits them in place, and **Add property** offers the
kinds of value to start from. Agree the names once and the views below stay
simple.

## Folder views

Click a folder in the sidebar and every flow below it, **subfolders
included**, is listed as a table: one row per flow, one column per property.
The tabs above the table are the **views**. The toolbar searches, picks the
columns and their order, sorts and filters, and what you set up is saved into
the view you are on.

![A folder as a table: three views as tabs, one column per property, and the toolbar that searches, sorts and filters](/help-images/folder.webp)

- **Properties** picks the columns and their order. Renaming one here writes
  a display name that every view follows. A property holding an object
  offers its fields as columns of their own, `xray.testKey` for instance.
- **Sort** stacks several clauses: the first that separates two flows wins.
- **Filter** decides which flows the view keeps: a property, an operator and
  a value, picked from dropdowns rather than typed, so a filter cannot be a
  syntax error. Groups combine with *all*, *any* or *none*, and nest. The
  operators, and how they read, are in
  [Filters and formulas](/help/view-expressions).
- **⋯ › Formulas** adds columns worked out from the others.
- **Run all** executes the flows the view is showing, as one test run.
- **CLI** writes the command that runs this same view from a terminal.

A view is **not tied to a folder**: every view is a tab on every folder, and
applies to whichever folder is open. Which one a folder was last opened with
is remembered in your browser.

Underneath, the views are one file, `views.yaml` at the root of the context,
in the shape [Obsidian Bases](https://help.obsidian.md/bases) uses. It holds
no folder references, so it is safe to commit and travels with the
repository:

    properties:
      note.owner:
        displayName: Owner
    formulas:
      depth: 'if(flow.steps > 3, "deep", "shallow")'
    views:
      - type: table
        name: Smoke
        filters:
          conjunction: and
          conditions:
            - property: note.suite
              operator: is
              value: smoke
        order: [file.name, note.owner, note.priority, formula.depth]
        sort:
          - property: note.priority
            direction: DESC

## Views are what a pipeline runs

A pipeline has to say which flows to run, and the usual answers age badly: a
list of files goes stale the day a flow is added, a folder is too coarse the
day it holds one slow flow, and a naming convention is enforced by nobody.

A view is a filter, evaluated **when the command runs**:

    ronsel --context e2e --view smoke --env uat

What runs is whatever matches today. A flow tagged `suite: smoke` tomorrow
runs tomorrow, one moved to another folder still runs, and none of it touches
the pipeline. Because the same view is a tab in the UI, what the pipeline will
run is never a guess: open the folder, pick the tab, and the table is the
list, with the count of matching flows updating as a filter is edited.
`--folder` scopes the same view to part of the tree when a pipeline should
only run its own corner.

A setup that tends to work: a `suite` property with a few agreed values, one
view per value (`smoke`, `regression`, `nightly`) filtering on it, and a
pipeline job per view. The **CLI** button of each view hands you its command.
A view with no filters is also a view: name it `all`, and `--view all` runs
everything.

Views live in `views.yaml`, so they travel with the repository and a change
to what a pipeline runs is a reviewable diff. How the values reach the
pipeline is in [Environments](/help/environments); the flags are in
[Command line](/help/cli).
