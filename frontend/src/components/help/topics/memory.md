A flow carries one plain object called the **memory**. It starts empty every
time you press *Run*, any step can write to it, and every later step can read
it. That is how the id created by step 2 ends up in the body of step 5.

### Writing it: the fourth value a method returns

A method returns a tuple — `[headers, status, body, memory]`. The first three
describe the response; the **fourth** is what this step contributes to the
memory.

    export const add = applications.handler([
      async (ctx: Context, parameters: Parameters) => {
        const { a, b } = parameters.body;
        const result = a + b;
        //       headers  status  body                            memory
        return [ {},      200,    { operation: 'add', result },   { lastResult: result } ];
      }
    ], 'add');

That fourth value is **optional**: leave it out, as most methods do, and the
step writes nothing. The helpers (`httpClient`, `pgClient`, `playwright`)
return the first three, so a method that wants to remember something builds
the object itself:

    const [headers, status, responseBody] = await httpClient.post(ctx, '/posts', { body });
    const memory = responseBody && responseBody.id ? { lastPostId: responseBody.id } : {};
    return [headers, status, responseBody, memory];

Writing conditionally like that is the normal thing to do — remember the id
only when there was one, so a failed call does not leave a stale value behind
for the steps that follow.

### How the writes add up

When a step returns, what it wrote is **merged** into the flow memory:

| | |
|-|-|
| New keys | Are added. |
| Keys that already existed | Are **overwritten** by the newer step. |
| Keys the step did not mention | Are left untouched. |
| Objects | Are replaced whole — the merge is shallow, not deep. |

So `memory.lastResult` always means *the most recent* result, and a step that
returns no memory changes nothing.

### Writing it from the flow: the step's `memory` mapping

The other way in belongs to the flow rather than to the method. A step can
name what it keeps out of what the method just returned:

    ```step
    application: app-cloud-ui
    method: dashboard_login
    memory:
      app_bearer_token: "{{ body.access_token }}"
    ```

Use it when the value is *in* the response but the method does not remember it
for you, or when the name the method uses is not the name the rest of the flow
wants to call it by.

The mapping is resolved **after** the step has run, and it can read:

| | |
|-|-|
| `body`, `status`, `headers` | The response of this step. |
| `steps.<id>....` | Any step so far, by its id or its `slug` — `{{ steps.login.response.body.access_token }}`. See [Step blocks](/help/step-blocks). |
| `memory.<key>` | The memory as it stands, including what this step just wrote. |

Three things it does differently from `parameters`:

| | |
|-|-|
| **Types survive** | A value that is nothing but one `{{ expression }}` is taken straight off the response, so a number stays a number and a token keeps its `=` instead of arriving as `&#x3D;`. Mix it into a sentence — `"Bearer {{ body.token }}"` — and it is text again, escaping and all. |
| **Nothing is written for nothing** | A key that resolves to empty is skipped, and says so in the run log. Whatever an earlier step remembered under that name stands. |
| **It has the last word** | The mapping is applied after the method's own fourth value, so a step can override what the method remembered. |

A value that is not a template — `environment: "local"` — is kept as written.

### Reading it: `{{ memory.key }}`

Anywhere inside a step's `parameters`, a Handlebars template reads the memory
as it stands when that step starts:

    ```step
    application: calculator
    method: multiply
    description: Multiply the previous result by 2, using memory
    parameters:
      body:
        a: "{{ memory.lastResult }}"
        b: 2
    test:
      status: 200
      body:
        result: 84
    ```

Nested values work the same way — `{{ memory.user.id }}`.

### What to watch out for

| | |
|-|-|
| **Earlier steps only** | A step sees what the steps *above* it wrote. A key nothing has written yet resolves to an empty string. |
| **Parameters only** | Only `parameters` are templated. `test` assertions are **not**, so `{{ memory.x }}` in a test is compared literally — write the expected value out, or assert it with a `$expr` expression, where `memory` is in scope: `"$expr: value === memory.barcode"`. See [Assertions](/help/tests). |
| **Everything arrives as text** | `a: "{{ memory.lastResult }}"` passes the string `"42"`, not the number `42`. Methods that expect numbers should accept numeric strings — the `calculator` example does exactly that. |
| **Reach for the leaf** | `{{ memory.user }}` renders `[object Object]`. Interpolate `{{ memory.user.id }}`, or read the object from application code. |
| **Text is HTML-escaped** | `{{ }}` turns `&` into `&amp;` and `'` into `&#x27;`. Triple braces `{{{ }}}` skip the escaping, but a value containing a double quote will break the step. |
| **Retries reuse the values** | Parameters are resolved once, before the first attempt. A `retry` re-sends exactly what was sent the first time; it does not re-read the memory. |
| **One run, one memory** | Memory is never shared between flows and does not survive a run. Press *Run* again and it is empty again. |

### Reading it from application code

A method's third argument is the flow, so `flow.memory` is the whole object —
useful when the value is not a scalar, or when the decision belongs to the
method rather than to the flow author:

    export const readBack = applications.handler([
      (ctx: Context, parameters: Parameters, flow: Flow) =>
        httpClient.get(ctx, `/posts/${flow.memory.lastPostId}`)
    ], 'readBack');

A validator can do the same declaratively: `validate.body` accepts
`fallbacks`, which fill a missing field from the memory before the schema is
checked — the flow may pass `token`, and when it does not, the one remembered
by an earlier login step is used.

    validate.body({
      type: 'object',
      properties: { token: { type: 'string' } },
      fallbacks: { token: [{ type: 'memory', key: 'authToken' }] }
    })

### Documenting it

Which keys a method writes (or reads) is part of its documentation, through
the `@memory` JSDoc tag:

    /**
     * @memory {write} lastResult - The result of the operation.
     * @memory {read} authToken - The token stored by the login step.
     */

The application page lists them per method under *Memory* — that is where to
look when you are writing a flow and need to know what a step leaves behind.
See [Documenting an application](/help/application-docs).
