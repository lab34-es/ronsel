/**
 * Copy non-TypeScript build assets into dist/.
 *
 * src/defaults holds the example applications and flows that are seeded into
 * the user's context directory on first run. They are templates executed in
 * *that* directory, not modules of this package: their TypeScript is
 * transpiled at run time by helpers/appLoader, which is also what resolves
 * their `ronsel` import. They are therefore copied verbatim and stay out
 * of the TypeScript program. helpers/bootstrap resolves them at
 * `__dirname/../defaults`, which is dist/defaults once compiled.
 *
 * frontend/dist is the compiled UI. Only `dist` is published, so the bundle has
 * to live inside it for `ronsel --server` to serve a UI from a global
 * install; api/index resolves it at `__dirname/../frontend`. It is optional
 * here because `npm run build` alone does not build the frontend -- publishing
 * goes through prepublishOnly, which does.
