/**
 * The types an application is written against.
 *
 * An application is user code living in the context directory, not in this
 * package, so these are the contract between the two: what the runner hands a
 * method, and what it expects back.
 *
 *   import { applications, httpClient } from 'ronsel';
 *   import type { Context, Parameters, Flow, MethodResult } from 'ronsel';
 *
 *   export const search = applications.handler([
 *     (ctx: Context, parameters: Parameters, flow: Flow): MethodResult =>
 *       httpClient.get(ctx, `/search/${parameters.query?.barcode}`)
 *   ], 'search');
 *
 * They are intentionally loose. Applications are transpiled, never type
 * checked, at run time (see helpers/appLoader), so the types exist to make the
 * editor useful rather than to police what a flow may do -- hence the index
 * signatures on the bags of data a flow carries around.
