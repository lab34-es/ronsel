 * themselves, which are a separate download:
 *
 *     npx playwright install chromium
 *
 * What it is here to show is how a flow gets values *out* of a browser and
 * keeps them. The page does what a real single-page app does when you sign
 * in: the server sets a session cookie, and the app writes the bearer token
 * it was given into local storage. Neither of those is on the screen, so
 * neither can be scraped -- they are read out of the browser itself with the
 * `cookies` and `storage` methods.
 *
 * Nothing a browser step collects reaches the flow memory on its own. The
 * flow says what is worth keeping, and under which name, with the step's
 * `memory` mapping -- see `flows/examples/04-browser-and-scraping.md`.

 * memory:

 *   "userId": 7,
